### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹
My name is Alan Zhang, and I am currently a second-year computer science
student at Northeastern University.

#### A Little About Me...
```
class Alan { 
    static String pronouns = "he/him";
    ArrayList<String> code = new ArrayList<>(
        Arrays.asList("Java"));
    ArrayList<String> languages = new ArrayList<>(
        Arrays.asList("English", "Chinese", "Spanish"));
```
